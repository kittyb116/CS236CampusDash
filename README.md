Project Description:

Two temporal endpoints
everything is set in minutes
Location of the task

minute column: when is it completed
USERID: is the dasher that completed the task (we don't need to use this information)
dasher can get to a location early
The minute column: when the task needs to be completed (make your life easier)
randomly generate the arrival (can use some numpy.random (0, minute[i]) and reward(which we can set as a range ex. 5-10) (????))
do NOT have to care about congestion

using predictions to feed into simulation (phase 2 is a separate step and not linked to the simulator)
